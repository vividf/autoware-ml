# PointTransformerV3

PointTransformerV3 is a LiDAR encoder for LiDAR 3D semantic segmentation and
3D object detection. The shared component is the hierarchical PTv3 **encoder**
(`PointTransformerV3Encoder`); each task owns its head:

- Segmentation: `PTv3SegDecoderHead` unpools the deepest encoder stage back to
  full resolution through the encoder skip chain and classifies each point.
- Detection: `PTv3DetBEVNeck` fuses the two coarsest encoder stages
  (`PTv3DetFeatureFusion`), scatters them onto a dense BEV canvas at the
  detection-head resolution, and feeds a `TransFusionHead`.

Because the detection branch taps the encoder only, finetuning the
segmentation head with a frozen encoder cannot change detection outputs - the
segmentation and detection checkpoints of a joint model stay independently
finetunable and stackable at deploy time.

The training path uses `flash-attn` for serialized attention. The export path
automatically disables flash attention and falls back to the standard attention
implementation so ONNX export remains supported.

## Training

```bash
autoware-ml train --config-name segmentation3d/ptv3/voxel005_51m_nuscenes
autoware-ml train --config-name segmentation3d/ptv3/voxel012_122m_t4dataset_j6gen2
autoware-ml train --config-name detection3d/ptv3/voxel005_51m_nuscenes
autoware-ml train --config-name detection3d/ptv3/voxel012_122m_t4dataset_j6gen2
```

For a pipeline validation run:

```bash
autoware-ml train \
    --config-name segmentation3d/ptv3/voxel005_51m_nuscenes \
    +trainer.fast_dev_run=true
```

## Evaluation

```bash
autoware-ml test \
    --config-name segmentation3d/ptv3/voxel005_51m_nuscenes \
    --weights mlruns/segmentation3d/ptv3/voxel005_51m_nuscenes/<run_id>/artifacts/checkpoints/best.ckpt

autoware-ml test \
    --config-name detection3d/ptv3/voxel012_122m_t4dataset_j6gen2 \
    --weights mlruns/detection3d/ptv3/voxel012_122m_t4dataset_j6gen2/<run_id>/artifacts/checkpoints/best.ckpt
```

## Deployment

PointTransformerV3 ONNX export is available. The generic TensorRT stage remains
disabled in Autoware-ML because PTv3 requires a runtime with matching sparse
convolution plugins.

```bash
autoware-ml deploy \
    --config-name segmentation3d/ptv3/voxel005_51m_nuscenes \
    --weights mlruns/segmentation3d/ptv3/voxel005_51m_nuscenes/<run_id>/artifacts/checkpoints/best.ckpt \
    deploy.tensorrt.enabled=false

autoware-ml deploy \
    --config-name detection3d/ptv3/voxel012_122m_t4dataset_j6gen2 \
    --weights mlruns/detection3d/ptv3/voxel012_122m_t4dataset_j6gen2/<run_id>/artifacts/checkpoints/best.ckpt \
    deploy.tensorrt.enabled=false
```

The deployment command switches PTv3 attention blocks into non-flash export
mode automatically.

Transformer blocks in the detection head are not fused by default. Bf16 is required
for numerically stable TensorRT operator fusion:

```yaml
model:
  bbox_head:
    use_bf16_cross_attention: true
deploy:
  onnx:
    precision: fp16
```

Both settings are required to enable the fused path, and the resulting model requires
an SM80 or newer GPU. Without both settings, export uses the stable but slower non-fused
attention path.

The exported ONNX model returns both `pred_labels` and `pred_probs`. The
probability output is produced by a final softmax layer, while training and
evaluation continue to use logits inside the Lightning model.

Deployment uses an explicit PTv3 export wrapper and a copied encoder, so the
training model is not mutated when export-only sparse-convolution and
serialization settings are applied.

### ONNX Preprocessing Contract

The exported PTv3 encoder ONNX expects all pooling-shape metadata to be
generated by preprocessing outside the engine. `N_0` is the input voxel count,
and `O` is the number of serialization orders.

| Base input           | Shape       | Meaning                                                                 |
| -------------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `grid_coord`         | `[N_0, 3]`  | Integer voxel coordinates.                                              |
| `feat`               | `[N_0, 4]`  | Per-voxel input features.                                               |
| `serialized_inverse` | `[O, N_0]`  | Inverse of the serialization order per curve (argsort of the codes).    |
| `patch_order`        | `[O, P_0]`  | The order padded to whole attention windows (see below).                |

`P_k = ceil(N_k / patch_size_k) * patch_size_k` is the padded slot count of level `k`.
The graph does not sort: preprocessing computes the input level's order anyway
to derive the pooling metadata, so it hands the result over instead of the codes.
The bare order is not an input — `patch_order` carries it in its first `N_0`
entries, and a declared input nothing reads would only be pruned by the tracer.
`patch_order` is the gather order the attention blocks read (`qkv[order]`): the
serialized order extended to a multiple of the window by borrowing the trailing
slots' tokens backwards along the serialization
(`(slot - patch_size + cycle) % N`, `cycle` the smallest multiple of `N` not
below `patch_size`). It depends only on the count, the order and the window, so
it is precomputed rather than traced into every block; the exporter records the
per-level window under the `patch_sizes` ONNX metadata key
(`build_patch_order` in `encoders/ptv3.py` is the reference implementation).

For every encoder pooling stage `i`, with input voxel count `N_i` and pooled
output voxel count `M_i`, preprocessing also provides:

| Pooling metadata                          | Shape       | Meaning                                                       |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `serialized_pooling_i_indices`            | `[N_i]`     | ONNX `Gather` indices grouping features before CSR reduction. |
| `serialized_pooling_i_indptr`             | `[M_i + 1]` | CSR row pointer consumed by `autoware::SegmentCSR`.           |
| `serialized_pooling_i_cluster`            | `[N_i]`     | Input voxel to pooled voxel id mapping for unpooling.         |
| `serialized_pooling_i_head_indices`       | `[M_i]`     | Representative input voxel for each pooled voxel.             |
| `serialized_pooling_i_grid_coord`         | `[M_i, 3]`  | Integer coordinates of pooled voxels.                         |
| `serialized_pooling_i_serialized_inverse` | `[O, M_i]`  | Inverse serialization order for pooled voxels.                |
| `serialized_pooling_i_patch_order`        | `[O, P_i]`  | The pooled level's order padded to whole attention windows.   |

Because preprocessing resolves every pooling shape ahead of time, the exported
graph contains no data-dependent pooling shape discovery. Pooled feature
reduction is implemented with native ONNX `Gather` and the
`autoware::SegmentCSR` plugin.

### Attention window fill at export

Serialized attention runs on fixed-size windows of `K = patch_size` tokens, so a
sample of `n` voxels needs its last window filled unless `n` is a multiple of `K`:

- `n % K == 0` - the windows are exact, nothing to fill.
- otherwise, `n > K` - the last window borrows tokens from the preceding one to
  reach `K`, which is what training does.
- otherwise, `n < K` - there is nothing to borrow from, so the sample's own
  tokens are cycled round-robin to equalize their weight in the softmax as far as
  possible.

Dynamic window sizes and masking are both awkward to express in TensorRT without
a performance penalty, hence this fill.

### Split-export module contract

The split export produces one graph per `deploy.onnx.modules` entry:

- `encoder` - the encoder; outputs per-stage features `point_feat_0` …
  `point_feat_{S-1}` (finest to deepest, `S` encoder stages). It consumes the
  per-stage pooling metadata **except** `serialized_pooling_i_cluster`, which
  only drives head-side unpooling and enters the head graphs as
  `pooling_cluster_i` instead.
- `seg3d_head` - consumes all per-stage features plus the per-pooling
  `pooling_cluster_i` tensors (the `serialized_pooling_i_cluster` metadata)
  and outputs `pred_labels`/`pred_probs`. For every decoder stage `i` with
  attention blocks (`dec_depths[i] > 0`) the graph additionally consumes that
  stage's serialization metadata, under the same names as the encoder
  inputs: `serialized_pooling_{i-1}_serialized_inverse`,
  `serialized_pooling_{i-1}_grid_coord` and `serialized_pooling_{i-1}_patch_order`
  (stage 0 instead takes the base `serialized_inverse`, `patch_order` and
  `grid_coord`). The rule is implemented once in
  `seg_head_export_input_names` and must be mirrored by deployment consumers
  from the artifact's `dec_depths`.
- `det3d_head` - consumes `point_feat_{S-2}`, `point_feat_{S-1}`,
  `pooling_cluster_{S-2}`, and `point_grid_coord_{S-2}` and outputs the
  detection head tensors.
