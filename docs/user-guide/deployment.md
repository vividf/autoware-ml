# Deployment

Autoware-ML exports trained models for production use. The pipeline converts
PyTorch checkpoints to optimized inference formats, one deployable module at a
time, and stamps every exported module with its identity and provenance.

## Deployment Pipeline

```text
Checkpoint (.ckpt) -> ONNX (.onnx) -> graph modifiers -> precision -> metadata stamp -> TensorRT (.engine)
```

Each stage runs per module. The stamp is applied to the final ONNX, so the
shipped file always carries its own metadata.

## Basic Usage

```bash
autoware-ml deploy \
    --config-name <task>/<model>/<config> \
    --weights mlruns/<task>/<model>/<config>/<run_id>/artifacts/checkpoints/best.ckpt
```

`--weights` accepts one or more checkpoint paths and is the only way to supply
parameters to the export model. For a single-task export, pass one
checkpoint. For a multi-head export, pass one `--weights` per source
checkpoint (see [Multi-head exports](#multi-head-exports)).

!!! warning
    Pass `--release vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` if the model is version controlled.
    Without it the artifacts are stamped `unversioned`, which is fine for
    quick iteration but never for a release build.

This generates one ONNX (`<module>.onnx`) and one TensorRT engine
(`<module>.engine`) per deployable module, when both stages are enabled and
supported by the model. The deploy command also creates a dedicated MLflow run
linked to the source training run and logs exported artifacts there.

You can disable either stage during iteration:

```bash
autoware-ml deploy \
    --config-name <task>/<model>/<config> \
    --weights mlruns/<task>/<model>/<config>/<run_id>/artifacts/checkpoints/best.ckpt \
    deploy.tensorrt.enabled=false
```

By default, deploy writes outputs into the deploy MLflow run's artifact
directory under `exports/`. Without MLflow logging, outputs land next to the
checkpoint.

When MLflow logging is enabled, any custom `output_dir` must stay inside that
run artifact directory. Leave `output_dir` unset to use the default
`exports/` location, or disable MLflow logging if you need to export outside
the run artifact tree.

**Custom output directory inside MLflow artifacts:**

```bash
autoware-ml deploy \
    --config-name <task>/<model>/<config> \
    --weights mlruns/<task>/<model>/<config>/<run_id>/artifacts/checkpoints/best.ckpt \
    output_dir=mlruns/<task>/<model>/<config>/<deploy_run_id>/artifacts/custom_exports
```

## Export Modules

A model exports one or more deployable modules. Models without a dedicated
export split produce a single module named `end_to_end`.

Every exported module must have a matching entry under `deploy.onnx.modules`,
and artifact files are named after the module. A module missing from the
config fails the deploy immediately.

## Multi-head exports

Multi-head export models can expose multiple deployable modules from one
configured model. `--weights` can merge checkpoints from independently
trained parts of that model into a single export:

```bash
autoware-ml deploy \
    --config-name detection3d/ptv3/voxel012_122m_t4dataset_j6gen2 \
    --weights mlruns/segmentation3d/ptv3/voxel012_122m_t4dataset_j6gen2/<run_id>/artifacts/checkpoints/best.ckpt \
    --weights mlruns/detection3d/ptv3/voxel012_122m_t4dataset_j6gen2/<run_id>/artifacts/checkpoints/best.ckpt
```

Checkpoints are applied in the order they appear on the command line, and
later checkpoints overwrite any keys already set by earlier ones. Each
checkpoint only contributes the state-dict keys that exist on the export
model and match its tensor shapes. Keys missing from the model are skipped.
Keys with a matching name but mismatching shape raise an error immediately.

**Full coverage is enforced.** After all checkpoints are loaded, deploy
verifies that every parameter in the export model has been covered by at
least one of the supplied `--weights`. If any parameter is left
uninitialized, the command fails up front with the list of missing keys
instead of producing an ONNX or engine that contains untrained layers. Add
or replace `--weights` entries until every key is covered.

## ONNX Metadata

Every exported module carries its identity and provenance inside the ONNX
file: producer, git commit of the export, release (encoded into
`model_version` as `major * 10000 + minor * 100 + patch`), the config name,
export date, and the linked deploy run.

Per-module inference parameters come from the deploy config's `metainfo`
block. The pipeline serializes whatever the config declares without
interpreting it:

```yaml
deploy:
  onnx:
    modules:
      <module>:
        metainfo:
          class_names: ${dataset.detection3d.class_names}
```

Each `metainfo` value is stamped as one compact JSON document (scalars,
strings, lists and mappings, nested as declared), while the provenance
properties above are plain strings, so a consumer reads a parameter with any
JSON parser. Non-finite floats, values JSON cannot represent, and keys that
collide with the automatically stamped properties fail at export time.

## Configuration

### ONNX Settings

Shared settings live at `deploy.onnx`. Per-module settings under
`deploy.onnx.modules.<module>` override them:

```yaml
deploy:
  onnx:
    enabled: true
    dynamo: true
    opset_version: 21
    precision: fp32
    dynamic_shapes:
      input_tensor: { 2: height, 3: width }
    modules:
      end_to_end:
        output_names: [output]
```

**input_names / output_names**: exported input names default to the export
spec's forward parameter names. Output names are declared per module.

**precision**: `fp32` exports the model unchanged. `fp16` halves the weights and
internal tensors but keeps graph inputs and outputs fp32, so consumers keep their
fp32 buffers either way. Calibrated precisions such as `int8` are out of scope here.

An fp16 export only works if the inference engine honors its dtypes instead of
reassigning them. In Autoware, that means `trt_precision: strongly-typed` on the
node.

**dynamic_shapes**: Keys are exported input names, values map dimension indices
to symbolic names. For the default export path these names come from
`forward()`. Models with explicit export wrappers define their own exported
input names through `build_export_spec()`.
You can also provide symbolic bounds when export needs them:

```yaml
deploy:
  onnx:
    dynamic_shapes:
      points:
        0: { name: num_points, min: 2 }
```

Set `dynamo: false` for models that rely on legacy ONNX symbolic functions
instead of `torch.export`. In that mode, `dynamic_axes` is passed to the legacy
exporter directly, and `dynamic_shapes` can still be used as a shorthand to
derive equivalent symbolic axes.

### TensorRT Settings

```yaml
deploy:
  tensorrt:
    enabled: true
    workspace_size: 8589934592  # 8 GiB
    input_shapes:
      input:
        min_shape: [1, 3, 224, 224]
        opt_shape: [1, 3, 256, 256]   # Optimized for this
        max_shape: [1, 3, 512, 512]
```

!!! tip
    TensorRT optimizes most aggressively for `opt_shape`. Set this to your typical inference resolution.

Engines are always built strongly typed: the builder uses exactly the precisions
the ONNX carries and never picks its own. Choose the engine's numerics with
`deploy.onnx.precision`.

## Model-Owned Export Wrappers

The preferred deployment path is to keep export logic inside the model. Models
with deployment-specific requirements should override `build_export_spec()` and
return an explicit export module plus example tensor inputs.

This keeps export-time behavior close to the model implementation and avoids
ad hoc post-processing for most cases.

## Optional Graph Modification

Post-export ONNX graph modification is still available as a fallback, shared
across modules or per module:

```yaml
deploy:
  onnx:
    modules:
      <module>:
        modify_graph:
          _target_: my_module.OnnxGraphModifier
          # modifier-specific parameters
```

Use for operator replacement, shape inference fixes, or custom plugin insertion.
Modifiers run before the precision conversion and the metadata stamp, so the
shipped file reflects them.

## Stage graph: verification and evaluation

Export alone produces artifacts; it does not prove they compute what the PyTorch
model computes. A model can opt into that proof by declaring its deployment as a
*stage graph* — an ordered list of exportable graphs (`GraphStage`) and the PyTorch
glue between them (`TorchStage`) — through `BaseModel.build_stages()`:

```python
def build_stages(self):
    return (
        TorchStage("decorate", run=lambda ctx: {"input_features": self.encoder.decorate(...)}),
        GraphStage("pts_voxel_encoder_centerpoint", module=..., inputs=("input_features",),
                   outputs=("pillar_features",)),
        TorchStage("scatter", run=...),
        GraphStage("pts_backbone_neck_head_centerpoint", module=..., inputs=("spatial_features",),
                   outputs=("heatmap", "reg", ...), output_fields=(("heatmap", "heatmap"), ...)),
    )
```

Every `GraphStage` is one `deploy.onnx.modules.<name>` entry and one `<name>.onnx` /
`<name>.engine`; the export specs are derived from the declaration (the graph runs once
in PyTorch on the example batch and each stage is traced with the tensors the glue
produced), so `build_export_specs()` needs no hand-written counterpart. Models without
a stage graph keep their existing `build_export_specs()`; nothing below applies to them.

The same declaration runs on three backends — `pytorch` (the modules), `onnx` (ONNX
Runtime sessions) and `tensorrt` (the engines) — with identical glue, so two backends
differ only by what executed the exported graphs. Two post-export steps use this, both
disabled by default:

### Verification

```yaml
deploy:
  verification:
    enabled: true
    num_verify_batches: 1
    scenarios:
      - { ref: { backend: pytorch, device: cuda }, test: { backend: onnx, device: cuda }, tolerance: 0.01 }
      - { ref: { backend: pytorch, device: cuda }, test: { backend: tensorrt, device: cuda }, tolerance: 0.5 }
```

Each scenario runs the reference and test pipelines on the first predict batches and
compares the final raw graph outputs element wise; a failing scenario fails the deploy.
Tolerances are calibrated, not guessed: lossy backends (fp16 engines, int8) set an
explicit per-scenario `tolerance`, and a failing tensor's message suggests the gate that
would have passed so the observed value can be recorded in the config comment. Raw-logit
differences under fp16 are expected while the metrics below stay equal — the metrics are
the real gate; verification catches wiring and dtype mistakes.

A model whose raw outputs are incomparable across backends by construction (stochastic
ordering, backend-specific proposal selection) sets `verification_caveat` to one sentence
saying why; verification then skips loudly.

### Evaluation

```yaml
deploy:
  evaluation:
    enabled: true
    split: test          # or val
    num_samples: -1      # whole split; a positive number for a quick check
    backends:
      pytorch: { enabled: true, device: cuda }
      onnx: { enabled: true, device: cuda }
      tensorrt: { enabled: true, device: cuda }
```

Every enabled backend with artifacts is scored on the split with the model's own metric
suites and the same `build_eval_output`, and its per-stage latency is collected
(`model_graphs` sums the exported stages: pure GPU time for TensorRT). Metric keys carry
the backend, `{split}/{backend}/{suite}/{metric}` (`test/tensorrt/det3d/mAP_0m_121m`),
latencies land under `latency/{backend}/{stage}_mean_ms`, and everything is logged to the
deploy run. The log ends with a cross-backend table of the suites' headline metrics; a
backend column whose stages ran in PyTorch (a declared fallback, e.g. a plugin graph on
ONNX Runtime) is starred.

## Overriding at Runtime

Override deployment settings from CLI:

```bash
autoware-ml deploy \
    --config-name <task>/<model>/<config> \
    --weights mlruns/<task>/<model>/<config>/<run_id>/artifacts/checkpoints/best.ckpt \
    deploy.tensorrt.input_shapes.input.opt_shape=[1,3,256,256] \
    deploy.tensorrt.workspace_size=8589934592
```
