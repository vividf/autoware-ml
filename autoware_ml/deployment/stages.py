"""Stage graph: one declaration of how a model splits into deployable graphs.

A model describes its inference as an ordered list of *stages* over a shared bag of
named tensors (the :class:`StageContext`):

- :class:`GraphStage` — an exportable sub-graph: an ``nn.Module`` plus the context
  names it reads (its ONNX input names) and writes (its ONNX output names). One
  ``GraphStage`` is one ``deploy.onnx.modules.<name>`` entry, one ``<name>.onnx`` and
  one ``<name>.engine``.
- :class:`TorchStage` — glue that is not exported (pillar decoration, BEV scatter, shape
  bookkeeping ...). It always runs in PyTorch, on every backend.

From the declaration, generic code derives the export specs and their trace inputs
(:mod:`.export_specs`), the artifact names (:func:`artifact_path`), and — once the
runners exist — the per-backend inference pipeline, verification and evaluation.
Nothing model-specific lives outside the model's own ``build_stages``.

        module: The traced module. Its positional forward arguments are the context
            tensors named by ``inputs``, in order.

        outputs: Names the module's outputs are written under — the ONNX output names,
            in the module's return order (a single tensor return maps to one name).
        output_fields: Only on the final stage: ``(output_name, key)`` pairs naming the
            key of the model's ``forward()`` output each ONNX output reassembles into,

        torch_fallback_backends: Backends on which this stage runs its PyTorch module
            instead of an artifact — for graphs a backend cannot execute, e.g. a
            plugin-op graph on ONNX Runtime. Naming ``tensorrt`` here also drops

            a property of the declaration rather than a per-config choice — a point
            model where every tensor is indexed by a point count, say. Becomes the
            derived spec's ``dynamic_axes``; a ``dynamic_axes`` under
            ``deploy.onnx.modules.<name>`` applies when the stage declares none.
        onnx_transforms: Rewrites applied to this stage's exported ``.onnx``, in order,
            each taking and returning the file path. For fusions intrinsic to the
            deployed form of this graph — folding a bias and an activation into a
            runtime plugin node, say — not for user-configurable graph surgery, which
