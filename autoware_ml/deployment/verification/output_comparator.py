"""
Pure output comparison for model verification.

This module contains `OutputComparator`, a stateless recursive comparator
for structured model outputs. Deployment verification expects pipeline raw
outputs that are **sequences (list/tuple) of tensors/arrays** and/or tensor
leaves; dict and bare scalar outputs are not handled (they fail with a type
mismatch).

Naming:
    - **OutputDiffSummary**: one object for the **whole output** — whether it
      passed, overall max/mean diff (aggregated), and first failure reason.
    - **TensorDiffDetail**: one row per **tensor** in the structure — path,
      shape, and that tensor's max/mean diff (for per-head logging).

Design notes:
    - No logging here; callers (e.g. ``BackendVerifier``) render logs.
    - :meth:`OutputComparator.compare` returns ``(OutputDiffSummary, list of
      TensorDiffDetail)`` in a single traversal.
