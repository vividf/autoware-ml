"""Derive the per-module export specs from a stage graph.

:func:`derive_export_specs` is what :meth:`BaseModel.build_export_specs` returns for a
model that declares ``build_stages()``: the stage graph runs once in PyTorch on the
example batch, and every :class:`~autoware_ml.deployment.stages.GraphStage` becomes one
:class:`~autoware_ml.utils.deploy.ExportSpec` whose trace inputs are the context tensors
it declares as inputs. The export loop in ``scripts/deploy.py`` consumes the result
exactly like a hand-written mapping.
