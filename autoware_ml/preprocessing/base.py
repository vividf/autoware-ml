"""Base classes for GPU-oriented batch preprocessing pipelines.

This module defines the shared preprocessing interface used between dataloaders
and model forward passes.

class DataPreprocessing:
    """Apply a sequence of preprocessing layers to a collated batch.

    This runtime pipeline runs after batch transfer, enabling hardware-accelerated
    preprocessing operations like voxelization, projection, and format conversion
    without registering the pipeline as part of the neural network.

    The pipeline follows a dict-in/dict-out pattern where each layer receives the
    current batch dictionary and returns updates to merge into it.

    Args:
        pipeline: List of callable layers to apply sequentially.
            Each layer should accept ``dict[str, Any]`` and return ``dict[str, Any]``.

    Example:
        ```python
        preprocessing = DataPreprocessing(
            pipeline=[
                Normalize(mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]),
            ]
        )
        batch = preprocessing(batch)  # Applied on GPU
        ```

        The pipeline is deliberately not registered as part of the neural
        network, so Lightning's ``model.train()``/``model.eval()`` never
        reaches it. Layers that behave differently between training and
        evaluation (for example a voxelizer with a larger evaluation budget)
        rely on the owning module forwarding its mode here.
