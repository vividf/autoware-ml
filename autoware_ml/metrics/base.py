"""Core metric framework shared across tasks.

Metrics are built on ``torchmetrics``. The design separates two concerns:

* A **suite** (:class:`MetricSuite`, a ``torchmetrics.Metric``) owns the
  accumulated state and its cross-GPU reduction via ``add_state``. It knows
  nothing about which metrics run. It only builds a task ``state`` object and
  hands it to whatever metrics were injected, once overall and once per range.
* A **metric** (:class:`Metric`) is a small, self-contained, injectable object
  that computes its own numbers from that state in ``evaluate`` and declares the
  stages it runs in.

This module holds only the task-agnostic pieces: the lifecycle ``EvalStage``,
the radial ``MetricRange`` used for distance buckets, and the two base classes.
