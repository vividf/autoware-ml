"""Inference backend names.

A *backend* is whatever runs the model's forward: the PyTorch modules themselves,
an ONNX Runtime session, or a TensorRT engine. PyTorch is a backend like any other
so that ``trainer.test`` and deployment evaluation report under the same metric
keys (``{split}/{backend}/{metric}``).
