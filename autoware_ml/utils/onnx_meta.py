"""ONNX metadata stamping for deployed artifacts.

Every exported module carries its provenance and inference parameters inside
the file itself: producer, release, config, export date and the per-module
``metainfo`` declared in the deploy config. Provenance properties are plain
strings and metainfo values are JSON documents, so any ONNX consumer can read
them with no side channel. The stamper is tracker-agnostic: whichever experiment
tracker is active reduces to the generic ``tracker`` / ``run_id`` values the caller
passes in.
