    Lightning derives ``val_check_batch`` once from the dataloader length seen at
    setup time, and with ``val_check_interval=1.0`` only runs validation when
    ``(batch_idx + 1) % val_check_batch == 0``. Samplers whose epoch length
    varies (e.g. ``GroupStreamingSampler``, whose per-epoch scene permutation
    changes how many tail frames are trimmed) make shorter epochs never hit that
    modulo, so validation is *silently skipped* and stale ``callback_metrics``
    feed the checkpoint monitor. This subclass additionally triggers validation
    whenever the epoch's actual last batch is reached and the epoch is due for
    validation per ``check_val_every_n_epoch``.
